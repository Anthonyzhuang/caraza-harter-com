<h1 class="my-5">Appropriate Academic Conduct</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

On behalf of the University of Wisconsin Computer Sciences department,
I would like to foster a clear understanding of unacceptable forms of
collaboration on computer science assignments, examinations, and other
written course work. This policy is a clarification of the general UW
Academic Misconduct policy
in <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/uws/14/03">UWS
14.03</a> as it applies to computer sciences coursework. When
developing computer software, hardware or algorithms, the most
desirable learning results when each student plays the major role in
the construction of his or her own work. Unacceptable collaboration in
computer sciences courses has, in the past, led to a variety of
disciplinary actions, including but not limited to zeros on
assignments, failure of the course, and letters filed with the Dean of
Students - I hope to prevent the need for such actions in the future
by stating this policy as clearly as possible.

<h2>The Policy</h2>

Students may submit only their own work, done without collaboration,
unless it is expressly stated otherwise by the instructor.

Students may complete the weekly programming assignments in groups
containing no more than two people. All quizzes and exams, whether
completed in person or electronically, must be completed
individually. Unacceptable use of the work of others occurs when a
student uses another's work illicitly or covertly, including one or
more of the following:

<ul>
  <li>communication of solution material related to an assignment from
  one student to another, either partially or entirely, in any
  form. Note that communication includes passive as well as active
  communication (for example, posting one's work publicly or leaving
  it unattended in the lab).
  <li>incorporation of material from a passive source (for example, a
web page found on a Google search) without proper acknowledgement or
citation.  comparison of solutions between or among students for the
purpose of possible revision.
  <li>Unacceptable use of the work of others is plagiarism; to use the
  work of others legitimately, you must first receive permission from
  the instructor and also acknowledge or cite the source of the
  outside help in your work.
</ul>

<h2>Prevention</h2> Keep your course work private and
password-protected. Keep your answers covered on exams. If you are at
all in doubt as to whether an act is a violation of this policy, ask
the instructor before engaging in it.

<h2>Detection</h2> Collaboration is usually very noticeable by graders
and surprisingly easy to confirm. The instructor will investigate the
origin of similarities in cases where two distinct submissions appear
to be the same in their code, even if identifiers have been renamed,
comments have been changed, etc.
