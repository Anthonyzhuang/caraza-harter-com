      <h4>Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</h4>
      <h6>Allen B. Downey</h6>
      <p>
	<i>Think Python</i> will be the primary text for our course
	for learning programming and the Python language.  We will be
	using the 2nd edition, which is written for Python 3 (do not
	use the 1st edition, which is written for Python 2).
      </p>

      <p>
	Although you may choose to purchase a hardcopy of the text,
	all the content is free online
	<a href="http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-0">
	This is a very concise text and assumes no prior programming
	experience, and it will provide our primary material for
	gaining basic programming experience.  We will rely on other
	materials for the "data" part of the course (e.g., plotting,
	analysis, etc).

    <h4>PythonAnywhere</h4>

    <p>
      You can sign up for a free account (which should suffice for our
    purposes) here:
      <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">https://www.pythonanywhere.com</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In a couple of the early lectures, we'll be learning some
      UNIX-shell basics to get you comfortable working in the
      terminal.  It will be easy for students running Linux or MacOS
      to follow along on their own machines, but PythonAnywhere will
      make it easy for students running Windows to follow along as
      well.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-0">
      Also, PythonAnywhere will make it easy for everybody to get
      started running Python programs, without needing to install
      Python on your own machine, so we'll use it to get everybody
      writing code fast.  Within a few weeks, though, we hope to get
      everyone running Python on their own computer (not on the
      website).

    <h4>Anaconda</h4>
    <p>
      It's not to hard to grab a Python installer online
      (e.g., <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/">here</a>),
      and there's a good chance you already have it installed,
      especially if you're running MacOS.  However, we want everybody
      to be on Python 3, and there are some additional extensions
      (called packages) that will help us do data science with Python.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-0">
      The easiest way to get a good Python setup with the necessary
      extras is to
      install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download">Anaconda</a>
      (be sure to get the 3.6 version or later).  However, this will
      be a large/slow install, and will not be necessary until later
      in the semester.  The list of extras provided with Anaconda are
      listed <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/py3.6_osx-64.html">here</a>.

    <h4>An Editor</h4>
    <p>
      An editor is just a program you use to write code (and other
      files).  Some editors might let you run your code, whereas
      others might require you to execute your program yourself in a
      separate terminal.  Ideally, an editor for this course will be
      be able to colorize Python code to make it easier to read.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are free to use any editor for CS 301 that you please.
      Popular ones include emacs, vim, Atom, and Notepad++.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-0">
      If you aren't sure what to use, we recommend using Visual Studio
      Code, a free editor from Microsoft that runs on Mac, Windows,
      and Linux.  You can install it
      here: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">https://code.visualstudio.com.</a>
