Lecture:

review (s)
 - flow of execution
 - state

you need to install two things, interpreter and editor! (s)

what is an interpreter? (s)
 - you (when doing worksheets)
 - why called interpreter?
   code -> brain       -> move hand
   code -> interpreter -> 010011110101
 - needs to be Python 3!

what is an editor? (s)
 - compare to browsers
 - features: integrated terminal, highlighting
 - talk about notebooks

do we have Anaconda Python? (d)
open terminal, run python
exit()

do we have PyCharm? (d)
download files from project
 - "Save Link As"
 - open in PyCharm (no project)
 - talk about nice colorization

terminal in PyCharm (d)
 - pwd, ls, cat
 - it's the same!!!

python in terminal
 - type ls, look it's broken!  Go back, it works
 - try broken command in and out
 - use it as a calculator

math operators
 - 1 + 1
 - plus is an "operator", the ones are "operands".  Binary operator (because two).
   an "expression" is the whole thing!
 - 1 - 1
 - add extra space, beginning, end, middle
 - multiply 1*1
 - (1)(1)         # error!
 - divide 1/1     # why

number types
 - type()
 - ignore "class"
 - type of float, type of int
 - type(1.0)
 - type(3/2)
 - type(3//2)

more math operators
 - % (modulo, think of it as the remainder)
 - unary operators: +, -
 - exponents: 10 ** 3, 16 ** (1/2), 2 ** -1
 - -5 ** 2
 - woah, why is it negative?!  Let's talk about operator precedence

operator precedence (s)

string stuff

comparison operators

boolean logic (s)

running files
 - run test.py
 - let's run a new program
 - why no output?
 - interactive vs. script mode
 - print statement (show without parens too)
