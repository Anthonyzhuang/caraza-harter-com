<p class="lead">
  CS 301 is a data-oriented course.  On this page, we'll maintain a
  collection of free, online datasets (or collections of datasets) you
  can use.  We'll use these for examples in class as well as projects.
  Or, you may find datasets here you want to explore to satisfy your
  own curiosity.  If you discover new interesting datasets, please
  email them to us, and we'll post them here if they seem to be of
  general interest.
