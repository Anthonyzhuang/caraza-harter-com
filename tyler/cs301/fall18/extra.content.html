      <h4>Thinking: Fast and Slow</h4>
      <h6>Daniel Kahneman</h6>
      <p>
	Kahneman explores the psychological aspects of statistical
	thinking, and explains a variety of cognitive biases that may
	arise when we estimate.
      </p>

      <p>
	For example, humans are better at averaging than summing.
	Implication: if you're trying to convince somebody of
	something, it's 3 good arguments alone are better than 3 good
	arguments plus 2 mediocre arguments (the latter increases the
	sum but drops the average).  Fast+Slow has many such examples
	that will help you be more persuasive and avoid making common
	cognitive mistakes about probabality.
