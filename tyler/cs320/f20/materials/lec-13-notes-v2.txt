tree: exactly one root; others have exactly one parent
 - lots of hiercharchical data in the world
 - people don't have family trees, only bacteria do
 - corporate hiercharchy, taxonomy
binary tree

if there's not a natural hiercharchical, we can impose one to
improve efficiency.

binary tree: max of 2 children per node
 - move a node?  or remove it?

========================================

IMPLEMENT BINARY TREE

Node class:
 - general tree vs. binary tree
 - self.left, right
 - dump method

In what order are nodes printed, after we add node D?
Work out on paper: call graph and timeline.

========================================

"D" in L
"D" in A # root

def contains:
    # 1: i have it, 2: left subtree has it, 3: right subtree has it

bug first:
if self.left.val == val:
   return True
