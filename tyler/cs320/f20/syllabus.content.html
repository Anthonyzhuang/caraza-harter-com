<h1 class="mt-5">Syllabus</h1>

<p>Welcome to Data Programming II!  We'll be building on what you
learned in Data Programming I.  In that course, we mostly worried
about getting the code <b>correct</b> -- in the first part of 320,
we'll start thinking about how to make it <b>efficient</b>.  Next,
we'll be learning more about the <b>Internet</b> (among other things,
you'll build a simple website for distributing a dataset)
and <b>advanced visualizations</b> like maps and animations.  We'll
conclude the course with a light introduction to <b>machine
learning</b> with the sklearn package.

<h3 class="mt-3">About Being Online...</h3>

<p>A major advantage of in-person classes is that it's easy to meet your
peers and learn from them.  So one of my priorities for this semester
is to make sure you get to know at least a few of your fellow students
well.  To facilitate this, we'll be randomly placing all of you in
groups of 4-7.  Policies will strongly encourage collaboration within
your team.  Each team will meet together (virtually) at a regular time
weekly to discuss course content and projects, starting in week 3.  A
peer mentor (or sometimes a TA) will join these meetings to help
answer tough questions you may have.

<p>Being online can also have advantages, like scheduling flexibility and
the ability to self pace.  Aside from the weekly team meeting,
everything is asyncronous: lectures, labs, quizes, and even the final.
As long as you keep ahead of the deadlines, you can decide when you
spend time on these things.

<p>I encourage you to take control of the pacing of lectures.  Say I'm
doing a coding demo in the lecture recording, and you've gotten a
little lost.  You should pause me and give it some thought -- or
better, type up the code yourself and play with it until it makes
sense!  Print more and think less.

<h3>Getting Help</h3>

There are a few ways to get help:
<ul>
  <li>Check for "walk"-in office hours (instructor, TA, and mentor): go to "Resources" menu and click "Office Hours"
  <li>Email your team's main TA (they'll reach out to you at the beginning of the semester)
  <li>Email me at tharter@wisc.edu to schedule an appointment outside of office hour time
</ul>

  <h3>Online Communication</h3>

<p>Besides email (described above), there are four ways we'll
  communicate outside of class.

<p><b>1. Piazza:</b> You can ask questions (and see the other
  questions) <a href="https://piazza.com/class/jzkcu4am8lmc3">here</a>.  <span class="text-danger">Do
    not post code snippets that are &gt;5 lines long, that's considered
    cheating.</span>

<p><b>2. Canvas:</b> We'll make announcements on Canvas and
  periodically upload grades there (detailed feedback will only be on
  this site, however)

<p><b>3. Class Forms:</b> We have <a href="surveys.html">various
    forms</a> for us to leave (optionally anonymous) feedback and report
  exam conflicts.

<p><b>4. Code Review:</b> You will upload projects
  using <a href="submission.html">this tool</a>.  Via the same tool, TAs
  will leave comments on your code.  <span class="text-danger">Even
    projects scoring 100% often have a lot of room for improvement, so
    please take these seriously</span>.  When submitting, you can ask for
  specific kinds of feedback, based on what coding skills you're most
  interested in developing.

  <h3>Lab</h3>

<p>"Lab" consists of at-home exercises to help you understand topics
  and prepare for projects.

  <p>You can decide when to do labs each weak, but I recommend finding
  a time when (a) other members of your team are also doing it, and
  (b) somebody is offering office hours.  Then, if you get stuck on
  something, you'll be able to get unstuck right away.

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>Grading breakdown
  <ul>
    <li><b>56%</b> - 7 projects (8% each)
    <li><b>28%</b> - 14 quizes (2% each)
    <li><b>10%</b> - final
    <li><b>6%</b> - participation
  </ul>

  <h3>Projects</h3>

<p><b>Submission:</b> Everybody will individually upload either a .py
  file or a .ipynb (as specified) file for each project with
  the <a href="submission.html">submission tool</a>.

<p><b>Collaboration:</b> Even though everybody will make their
individual submission, every project will have (1) a <b>team part</b>
and (2) an <b>individual part</b>.  For the team part, any form of
help from anybody on your team is allowed (even looking at each
other's code); I recommend you find times for everybody on the team to
work at the same time so you can help each other through coding
difficulties in this part.  For the individual part, you may only
receive help from course staff (instructor/TAs/mentors); you may not
discuss this part with anybody else (in the class or otherwise) or get
help from them.

<p><b>Late Policy:</b> You will have 7 late days, which you can use
  across projects at your own discretion.  You may use all your late
  days on the same project, if you like.  Using late days on a project
  does not defer the deadline for subsequent projects, so be careful
  not to let work pile up.  You <b>may not</b> use late days on the
  last project.  Late days are automatically applied if a project is
  turned in late.  After late days are exhausted, anything late will
  receive zero credit by default.  Please talk to me if you're falling
  this far behind.

<p><b>Code Review:</b> A TA will give you detailed comments on
  specific parts of your assignment.  This feedback process is called
  a "code review", and is a common requirement in industry before a
  programmer is allowed to add her code changes to the main codebase.
  Read your code reviews carefully; even if you receive 100% on your
  work, we'll often give you tips to save effort in the future.

<p><b>Project Grading:</b> Grades will be based on automatic tests
  that we run.  We'll share the tests with you before the due date, so
  you should rarely be surprised by your grade.  Though it shouldn't
  be common, we may deduct points for serious hardcoding, not
  following directions, or other issues.  Also, some bugs (called
  non-deterministic bugs) don't show up every time code is run -- if
  you have such an issues, we may give you a different grade based on
  the tester than what you were expecting based on when you ran it.

  <h3>Quizzes</h3>

  <p>There will be a short quiz at the end of each week.  I recommend
  taking it soon after you've studied the week's content, but the
  deadline is (usually) Monday of the following week at 11:59pm.  Make
  sure you know the rules regarding what is allowed and what is not.

    <h5>Allowed</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>however much time you need
        <li>discussing answers with members of your assigned team who are taking the quiz at the same time
        <li>referencing texts, notes, or provided course materials
        <li>searching online for general information
      </ul>

      <h5>NOT allowed</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>taking it more than once
          <li>discussing answers with anybody outside of your team
          <li>discussing with members of your team who have already completed the quiz
          <li>posting anything online about the quizzes
          <li>using such material potentially posted by other 320 students who broke the preceding rule
        </ul>

<h3>Extra Support/Accomodations</h3>

<p>As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can cause
barriers to learning. These might include strained relationships,
anxiety, high levels of stress, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down,
loss of loved one, and/or loss of motivation. It is important to be
aware that services exist on campus to support students who find
themselves in these situations. There are several avenues for support,
including: University Health Services and the Dean of Students
Office. You can learn more about free, confidential mental health
services at UHS by calling 608-265-5600 Opt. 2 or visiting
<a href="https://uhs.wisc.edu">uhs.wisc.edu</a>. Drop-in staff are available daily at the Dean of
Students Office to support students and answer questions. To learn
more about the Dean of Students Office, please call 608-263-5700 or
visit <a href="https://doso.students.wisc.edu">doso.students.wisc.edu</a>.

<p>In general, if you have any issues keeping up with the course for
any reason, it's better to let me know -- I'll do my best to connect
you with resources and try to think of accomodations to help out.

<h3>Cheating</h3>

<p>Yeah, of course you shouldn't cheat, but what is cheating?  The
  most common form of academic misconduct in these classes involves
  copying/sharing code for programming projects.  Here's an overview
  of what you can and cannot do:

<p><b>Acceptable</b>
  <ul>
    <li>any collaboration with your team members on the team part
    <li>doing worksheets with friends
    <li>copying code examples from online examples that is NOT specific to your project (if project solutions are leaked online, you may not use that).  If you copy code, you must cite it in your code with a comment (think of it like citing a quote in a essay -- without the cite, you're plagarizing).
    <li>any help from other students on the final (with citation)
  </ul>

<p><b>NOT Acceptable</b>
  <ul>
    <li>getting project help of any kind for the team part from anybody who is not either (a) on your assigned team or (b) 320 staff
    <li>getting project help of any kind for the individual part from anybody who is not 320 staff
    <li>getting help during a quiz from anybody who is not both (a) on your assigned team and (b) currently taking the quiz themselves
    <li>using part or all of project solutions found online
    <li>breaking any of the rules listed under the "Quizzes" section
    <li>helping somebody else cheat
  </ul>

<p><b>Similarity Detection:</b> of course, with &gt;100 students, it's
  hard for a human TA to notice similar code across two submissions.
  Thus, we use automated tools to looks for similarities across
  submissions.  Such similarity detection is an active area of computer
  science research, and the result is tools that detect code copying
  even when students methodically rename all variables and shuffle the
  order of their code.  We take cheating detection seriously to make the
  course fair to students who put in the honest effort.

<p><b>Citing Code:</b> you can copy small snippets of code from
  stackoverflow (and other online references) if you cite them.  For
  example, suppose I need to write some code that gets the median number
  from a list of numbers.  I might search for "how to get the median of
  a list in python" and find a solution
  at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python</a>.

<p>I could (legitimately) post code from that page in my code, as long as
  it has a comment as follows:

  <pre class="example">
    # copied from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python
    def median(lst):
      sortedLst = sorted(lst)
      lstLen = len(lst)
      index = (lstLen - 1) // 2

      if (lstLen % 2):
        return sortedLst[index]
      else:
        return (sortedLst[index] + sortedLst[index + 1])/2.0
  </pre>

<p>In contrast, copying from a nearly complete project (that
  accomplishes what you're trying to do for your project) is not OK.
  When in doubt, ask us!  The best way to stay out of trouble is to be
  completely transparent about what you're doing.

  <h3>Recommendation Letters</h3>

<p>Earning a recommendation letter is much harder than earning an A in
this course.  At a minimum, I'll want to see you doing something
complex and interesting beyond the assingments.  For a typical letter,
I'll have collaborated with a student on some project for multiple
  months, with many iterations of feedback.

  <p>Most grad schools require recommenders to fill long forms rating
students on various abilities (see an example below).  Make sure that
if you're asking me, I would be able to fill such a form without
needing to put "I don't know" as my answer to many of the questions.
