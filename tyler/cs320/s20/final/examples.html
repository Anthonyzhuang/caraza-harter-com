<h1>Final Project Examples</h1>

This is a showcase of interesting, instructor-selected final projects,
made public with student permission.  The projects are in no
particular order.  In some cases, students wanted to make their work
public while remaining anonymous (their names have been removed).

Note: every project originally had an acknowledgement page.  I (Tyler)
removed these to preserve confidentiality of other students, who's
contributions were listed on these pages. I've also made some other
small edits (removing large data files, fixing links).  Drop me an
email if you see any issues!
