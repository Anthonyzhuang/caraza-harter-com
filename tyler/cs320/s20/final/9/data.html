    <h1>Data Sources</h1>
      <h3> National Climate Data Center</h3>
      <p>The first data source I used was daily weather summaries provided by the national climate data center. Every day weather stations around the nation record the low temperature, high temperature, and inches of precipitaion for the day. I selected 48 stations, 1 within each of the continental United States, and integrated all datapoints from January 1, 1970 to December 31, 2019 into my data. The only issue encountered within the data is a cluster of missing precipitation data within Missouri util 1982.

      <h3> Nation Center of Environmental Information Severe Weather Data </h3>
      <p> This dataset tracks each time a severe of threatening climatological or ecological event occurs. The dataset contains the type of event, and for certain events like tornadoes or thunderstorms, the magnitude of the event. The data also includes the state and date that an event occured. An interesting aspect of this dataset I was unable to explore due to a large volume of missing data was the cost of structural damage imparted by and event. I used this data set to investigate changes in occurences of certain natural disasters, as well as the changing magnitudes of American Tornadoes.Access this dataset <a href= 'ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/'> here. </a></p>
      <h3>Climate Change Performance Index</h3>
      <p>The Climate Change Performance Index is a yearly report rating the actions of nations around the world, based on 4 factors: Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Renewable Energy, Energy Use, and Climate Policy. The 61 countries assesed in this dataset are all high emmiting countries based on their status as developed nations. Each nation recieves Due to a historical fossil fuel economy, which has embedded itself in our politics, the United States ranks lowest on this list. <a href= 'https://www.climate-change-performance-index.org/sites/default/files/documents/ccpi_2020_international_press_release.pdf
