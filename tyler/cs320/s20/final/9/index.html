    <h1>How Climate Change has Already Affected the United States</h1>
      <h3> By Grant Gilcrease gilcrease@wisc.edu</h3>
    <p>In this project, I use data from the US National Climate Data Center Daily Weather Summaries, National Ceneter for Environmental Information's Annual Severe Weather Reports, and the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index to identify symptoms of a changing in the United States and too adress the national response. <a href="data.html">Go to this page to learn how to access the data yourself.</a> In the report, I identify how warming often disuises itself in a lack of cooling, as national average temperature lows are rising. I show that while precipitation is not increasing as rapidly as other factors, the increased prevalence of many life threatening natural disasters, including tornadoes and flash floods, should still be reason for concern. Lastly, I explore the Climate Change Performance Index and encourage the reader to ponder why the United States ranks last in it. <a href = 'results.html'>Read the report here.</a></p>
