<h1>Tornadoes for Dummies</h1>
<h3>by Jack Richter and Cole Darling</h3>
<p> This website is a brief introduction to tornadoes in the United States (1950-2019) and the various data associated with them. Tornadoes are monstrous feats of nature that are both incredibly fascinating and incredibly dangerous. We made this website in order to help people understand tornadoes and help people stay safe from tornadoes. There are three content pages included in this website: data.html, results.html, and ack.html. The data page explains our dataset and where we got it from, the results page displays the plots and conclusions we made in order to better understand the dataset, and the acknowledgements page notes the resources that helped us create this project. Topics addressed in this project include: tornado patterns, tornado consequences, and tornado maps. Have fun exploring the tornado data! </p>
