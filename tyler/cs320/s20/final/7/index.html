        <p><b> Introduction </b> <br />
Immigration and its effect on society in the United States has long been a contentious issue. A particular instance of such debate is the ongoing discussion surrounding the goals of the Trump administration to suppress cross-country immigration from Mexico. Politicians who tend to favor higher regulation of our Southern border often cite higher crime rates among immigrants as a motivating factor. This study will analyze the relation between crime in the U.S. and rates of immigration, with an emphasis on the states which share a border with Mexico.
