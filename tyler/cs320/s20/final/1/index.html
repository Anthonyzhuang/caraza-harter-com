<h1>Water Quality in the Yahara Lakes</h1>
<p>Taylor McHone tmchone@wisc.edu</p>

<p>This project focuses on the quality of water and the health of the Yahara Lakes. The earliest measurements used in this project are from 1935, <br>but there are many gaps in the data so much of this project only takes into consideration data beginning in 1985. The plots examine factors<br> related to algae blooms, water hardness and conductivity and aim to help policy makers determine if current lake management is sufficient or <br>if more should be done to improve the health of the lakes. </p><br>
