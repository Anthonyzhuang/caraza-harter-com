# dotData Docker Workshop

In this workshop, I'll answer the following questions:

1. what is virtualization, and what are the tradeoffs between using virtual machines and containers?
2. how do containers help with reproducibility?
3. how do you deploy a web server or database using containers?
4. how do you create your own container images?

We'll also be learning the following Docker commands: `pull`, `images`, `run`, `ps`, `rm`, `rmi`, `build`
